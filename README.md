# stacktrace_view

Parse and visualize stacktraces of outliers, as they are generated by [Flask-MonitoringDashboard](https://github.com/flask-dashboard/Flask-MonitoringDashboard).

An element in the stacktrace is uniquely represented as a 4-element tuple:
```
(file_name, line_number, function, text of line)
```

Before running the script, set the path for the sqlite3 db file.
